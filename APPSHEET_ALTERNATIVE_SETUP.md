# AppSheet Setup - Alternative Methods

## Problem: No REST API Option Visible

The REST API data source option in AppSheet can be hard to find or may require a specific plan. Here are working alternatives:

## Method 1: Use Google Sheets as Bridge (Recommended)

This is the most reliable way to connect AppSheet to your patient data.

### Step 1: Set Up Google Sheets Integration
1. **Create Google Sheets API Integration** (I can help you build this)
2. **Sync patient data** to Google Sheets automatically
3. **Connect AppSheet** to the Google Sheet (AppSheet loves Google Sheets!)

### Benefits:
- ✅ AppSheet has excellent Google Sheets support
- ✅ Real-time data sync
- ✅ Works with all AppSheet plans
- ✅ Easier to debug and manage

## Method 2: Find REST API Option in AppSheet

The REST API option might be under different names:

### Try These Locations:
1. **"Cloud API"** instead of "REST API"
2. **"Web Service"** or "API Service"
3. **"External Data"** → "API Connection"
4. **Advanced Data Sources** section
5. **Enterprise features** (might require paid plan)

### Check Your AppSheet Plan:
- **Starter Plan**: May not include REST API
- **Core Plan ($5/user)**: Should include REST API
- **Team Plan ($10/user)**: Definitely includes REST API

## Method 3: Export to CSV for Initial Setup

For immediate testing:

### Quick CSV Setup:
1. **Export patient data** to CSV format
2. **Upload CSV** to Google Drive
3. **Connect AppSheet** to the CSV file
4. **Test mobile interface** with your data
