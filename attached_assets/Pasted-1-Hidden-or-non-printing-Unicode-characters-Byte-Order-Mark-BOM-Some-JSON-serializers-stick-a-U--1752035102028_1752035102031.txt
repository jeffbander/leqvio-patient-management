1. Hidden or non-printing Unicode characters
Byte Order Mark (BOM): Some JSON serializers stick a U+FEFF at the start of strings.

Zero-width spaces/joiners: U+200B or U+200C can sneak in when concatenating or copying.

Non-breaking spaces vs normal spaces: U+00A0 vs U+0020.

How to detect in Replit/JS

js
Copy
Edit
let id = receivedFromApi;
console.log(Array.from(id).map(c => c.charCodeAt(0).toString(16)));
// e.g. [ '42','61','6e','64','65','72', … ] should exactly match your expected hex codes
If you see any codes you don’t expect (like feff, 200b, a0), you know you’ve got an extra character.

2. Different “underscore” characters
Not all underscores are U+005F. You might have a “fullwidth underscore” (U+FF3F) or some other look-alike.

Fix: In your debug log (above), confirm every underscore shows up as 5f. Anything else you’ll need to replace, e.g.:

js
Copy
Edit
id = id.replace(/\uff3f/g, '_');
3. Trailing or leading whitespace
APIs sometimes pad or trim in unexpected ways.

Quick test in AppSheet:

appsheet
Copy
Edit
/* compare lengths */
LEN([PPD_Patient_Link]) <> LEN("Bander_Jeffrey__11_29_1976")
If that’s TRUE, you know there’s an extra space somewhere. Then:

appsheet
Copy
Edit
/* trim both sides */
TRIM([PPD_Patient_Link]) = TRIM("Bander_Jeffrey__11_29_1976")
4. Encoding mismatches (UTF-8 vs Latin-1)
If your client or server mis-labels the charset, a multi-byte UTF-8 sequence can get mangled. You’ll see odd replacement chars (�) or garbled bytes.

How to confirm: In your Replit code, force UTF-8 and inspect Buffer.from(id, 'utf8') vs Buffer.from(id, 'latin1').

5. JSON escaping left in the string
If your API layer double-escapes, you might literally be getting \u005f in your string instead of _.

Detect:

js
Copy
Edit
console.log(id.includes('\\u005f'));  // if true, you have escaped text
Then unescape it:

js
Copy
Edit
id = id.replace(/\\u([0-9A-Fa-f]{4})/g, (_, hex) => String.fromCharCode(parseInt(hex,16)));
Next steps to debug on your side
Log the raw codepoints coming over the wire (see snippet above).

Compare that array to the array for a known good literal.

Normalize/clean the incoming string in your Replit code before sending it on (e.g. .trim(), .replace(/[\u200B-\u200D\uFEFF]/g,''), .normalize('NFC')).

Then confirm in AppSheet with your LEN() or IN() test that the cleaned value now matches exactly.

Once the characters coming from Replit are truly U+005F for underscores, true ASCII letters, and no hidden bytes, your AppSheet = "Bander_Jeffrey__11_29_1976" will work every time.
